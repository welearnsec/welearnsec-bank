## üéØ Vulnerabilities Covered

This lab includes scenarios inspired by the **OWASP API Security Top 10 (2023)** and **classic SQL Injection**, such as:

1. **Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA)**  
2. **Broken Authentication**  
3. **Broken Object Property Level Authorization (BOPLA)**  
4. **Unrestricted Resource Consumption**  
5. **Broken Function Level Authorization**  
6. **Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Business Flows**  
7. **Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**  
8. **Security Misconfiguration**  
9. **Improper Inventory Management**  
10. **Unsafe Consumption of APIs**  
11. **SQL Injection (Classic + Error-Based)**

Each endpoint is designed to highlight specific flaws for practical testing and exploitation.
